          <h2 class="title">About</h2>
          <span>
            I'm an artist, writer, coder, general tinkerer, and Software Engineer at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com">Microsoft Docs</a>, previously the development team lead at <a href="https://yesler.com">Yesler</a>. Based in Seattle Washington. I've had the opportunity to work on a number of great projects and my work focuses on bringing design and development together to build functional and visually interesting web experiences. I started developing as a hobby in the early 2000's and have been developing professionally for the past 10 years. I am not code exclusive but tend to focus on the front-end, JavaScript, Typescript, Node, CSS/SASS, build, and dev process.

            Artistically I've worked heavily in printing (letterpress / relief) and creative writing. Over the past year+ I have started to bring these techniques over to new formats (canvas, JS, penplotting). Seeing the value my professional skills (code) bring to my art has been mesmerizing and lots of fun.

          <span>
            Outside of the 9 to 5, I work on a number of side projects and due to my proximity to great trout fisheries here in Washington, you can find me fly fishing many weekends.
            <br><br>
            I'm also an avid reader. Below is a list of some books I really enjoyed this year+ (need to read more):
