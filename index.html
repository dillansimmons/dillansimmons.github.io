          <span>
            I'm an artist, writer, general tinkerer, and Software Engineer Manager at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/">Microsoft Q&A</a>. Based in Seattle Washington. I've had the opportunity to work on a number of great projects and my work focuses on bringing design and development together to build functional and visually interesting experiences. I started developing as a hobby in the early 2000's and have been a professional engineer for the past 10+ years. While I came up on the front-end (JavaScript, Typescript, Node, CSS/SASS), I work in back-end and devops code as well and now focus on management and process (especially AI in engineer workflows).

            Artistically I've worked heavily in printing (letterpress / relief) and creative writing. Over the past few years I have started bring these methods into digital art created with code. Seeing the value that my professional skills (code) bring to my art has been mesmerizing and lots of fun. Most of my work falls under the category of generative art, meaning the code will output a (nearly) endless array of outputs based on a random hash value. Above is a small selection of different works.

          <span>
            Outside of the 9 to 5, I have a young son, work on a number of side projects, and due to my proximity to great trout fisheries here in Washington, you can find me fly fishing many weekends.
